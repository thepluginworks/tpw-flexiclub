# Gallery Admin — User Guide

This guide helps site administrators manage image galleries using the shared plugin framework’s Gallery Admin.

## Access
- Route: `/gallery-admin/` (front‑end admin system page)
- Shortcode: `[tpw_gallery_admin]` — include on a page if not auto‑created
- Permission: Administrators (temporary capability `manage_options`)

## Create a Gallery
1. Click "Add Gallery".
2. Enter a Title and (optional) Description.
3. Choose a Category (or leave Uncategorised).
4. Click "Save Gallery".

## Add Images
- "Add Images" menu:
  - From Media Library: pick existing images; they are linked into the gallery.
  - Upload New Files: select images to upload; the gallery auto‑saves if needed.

## Edit Images
- Caption: Click the caption to edit, then Save or Cancel.
  - Save applies immediately; Cancel discards changes.
- Focal Point: Click the image (or "Focal" button) to open the focal editor.
  - Click or drag the green handle to set the focus; Save to apply.
  - The editor page thumbnail recenters to the saved focal point.

## Reorder Images
- Drag and drop thumbnails to change order.
- Order is saved automatically to the gallery.

## Remove vs Delete
- Remove: Unlinks the image from the gallery only (keeps it in Media Library).
- Delete: Permanently deletes the image from the Media Library (cannot be undone).

## Manage Categories
- Use "Manage Categories" to add or delete categories.
- The gallery form’s Category dropdown updates after closing the modal.

## Quick Edit vs Full Page
- Quick Edit: Opens a modal for lightweight changes.
- Edit (Page): Opens the full Gallery Editor for larger galleries and drag‑drop.

## Public Display
- Use `[tpw_gallery id="123"]` to show a gallery on public pages.
- Optional view modes:
  - Grid (default): `[tpw_gallery id="123" view="grid"]`
  - List: `[tpw_gallery id="123" view="list"]`
  - Story/Carousel (inline): `[tpw_gallery id="123" view="story"]` — one image at a time with Previous/Next, swipe, and arrow keys; no autoplay.
- Thumbnails crop to fit and honor focal points; captions are shown below (grid/list) or prominently with the image (story).

## Elementor Widget (Optional)

If Elementor is installed and active, the shared framework provides an Elementor widget named **TPW Gallery**. This is often the easiest way to add a gallery to a page without writing shortcodes.

How to use:
1. Edit the page in Elementor.
2. Search for **TPW Gallery** in the widgets panel.
3. Drag it onto the page.
4. In the widget settings:
   - **Gallery**: Start typing to search galleries by title, then select one.
   - **View**:
     - **Grid**: Thumbnail grid.
     - **List**: Vertical list with captions.
     - **Story**: Inline carousel (one image at a time).
   - **Columns**: Only shown for **Grid**; sets the number of columns.
   - **Paginate**: Only shown for **Grid** and **List**; when enabled, the gallery displays a page at a time.
   - **Per page**: Only shown when **Paginate** is enabled; how many images to show per page.

### Large gallery performance
- If a gallery has lots of images, you can limit how many thumbnails render at once (grid/list only):
  - Enable pagination with a default page size: `[tpw_gallery id="123" view="grid" paginate="1"]`
  - Or set an explicit limit: `[tpw_gallery id="123" view="list" per_page="40"]`

## Tips & Troubleshooting
- If changes don’t appear, refresh and ensure browser cache isn’t stale.
- The focal point is stored per image; set it for portraits to improve crops.
- You must Save the gallery to create it before uploading files.
- Only administrators can access `/gallery-admin/`.
